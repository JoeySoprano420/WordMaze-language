### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

#### 1. Lexer and Parser Development using YACC/Bison and ANTLR

**Tasks:**
- **Lexer Development (YACC/Bison):**
  - Define token rules for your programming language.
  - Handle whitespace, comments, and special characters.
  - Implement error handling for invalid tokens.

- **Parser Development (ANTLR):**
  - Define grammar rules based on your language specifications.
  - Construct the syntax tree (AST) from tokens generated by the lexer.
  - Implement error recovery and reporting mechanisms.

**Steps:**
- Set up YACC/Bison or ANTLR environment in your development setup.
- Define lexer and parser specifications based on your language grammar.
- Test lexer and parser with sample input to ensure correct tokenization and parsing.

#### 2. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Intermediate Representation (IR)

**Tasks:**
- **AST Definition:**
  - Design node structures for expressions, statements, and control flow.
  - Implement methods for AST traversal and manipulation.

- **Semi-Binary IR:**
  - Choose an IR format suitable for your compiler backend.
  - Define IR operations and transformations for efficient code representation.

**Steps:**
- Create AST classes or structures in your programming language.
- Implement methods to construct the AST from parsed input.
- Design and implement basic IR operations and transformations.

#### 3. Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler with G++

**Tasks:**
- **Compiler Phases:**
  - Lexical analysis (tokenization).
  - Parsing (constructing AST).
  - Semantic analysis (type checking, scope resolution).
  - Optimization (IR transformation for performance).
  - Code generation (translating IR to executable code).

**Steps:**
- Implement each phase of the compiler in sequence.
- Integrate with G++ for backend code generation.
- Test compiler with sample programs, validate output against expected results.

#### 4. Integration with AGI Model and Codebank

**Tasks:**
- **AGI Integration:**
  - Develop APIs to interact with AGI models for code understanding and generation.
  - Implement code suggestions and completions based on machine learning models.

- **Codebank Integration:**
  - Create interfaces to manage code repositories and version control.
  - Sync codebank with AGI model for real-time updates and access.

**Steps:**
- Design API endpoints for AGI interactions (e.g., code understanding, generation).
- Implement data synchronization between codebank and AGI model.
- Validate integration with sample queries and responses.

#### 5. IDE Integration with Injector Functions

**Tasks:**
- **IDE Plugin Development:**
  - Create plugins or extensions for popular IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Implement syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking.

**Steps:**
- Develop injector functions to embed compiler and interpreter functionalities.
- Test IDE plugins with different programming scenarios.
- Ensure compatibility and seamless integration with IDE workflows.

### Summary

Each step involves detailed planning, implementation, and testing to ensure the compiler, interpreter, and IDE integrations function correctly. Progressively building from lexer/parser development to compiler construction and integrating with advanced functionalities like AGI and IDEs will establish a comprehensive programming environment. This approach ensures robustness, efficiency, and usability across various development tasks and scenarios.
